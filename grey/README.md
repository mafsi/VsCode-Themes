## Meaning Of Gray: Explained

Morally ambiguous and impartial, gray is the color of complexity–everything that falls in between absolutes. Gray can be easily overlooked, but it’s quite a fascinating color if you look a little deeper.

## Physical Effects

They physical effects of gray are less pronounced than other colors, but it tends to have a dampening effect–both on other colors and on our moods. It’s calm and dispassionate, but too much gray, particularly if it’s a dark gray–can be depressing. Gray is the perfect neutral, as it can moderate brighter hues and pull a color scheme together.
